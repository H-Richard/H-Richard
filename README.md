### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Richard, and welcome to my Github

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I'm based in Toronto, CA.

ðŸ¥° My favorite technologies are [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Golang](https://golang.org/). ([Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Deno](https://deno.land/) are cool too)

ðŸ‘” I work at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en) as a Software Engineer Intern. For more information about me, check out my website [h-richard.com](https://h-richard.com/).

  I want to revisit Asia sometime and experience the technology scene there, I heard the developers there love to use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> ðŸ¤­. Also might take a crack at some AR/VR projects.
